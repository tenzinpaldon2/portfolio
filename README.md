### PROJECTS			
Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning
Developed machine learning models using data from two schools in Portugal to predict final grades (G3) based on features like study habits, parental education, travel time, and past course failures.
Implemented Linear Regression, SVM Regression, and Lasso Regression to analyze performance; achieved an RMSE of 2.26 and R² of 0.75 with models including G1 and G2 (previous term grades).
Designed a secondary model excluding G1 and G2 to enable early intervention, helping schools identify and support struggling students in a timely manner.
Optimized SVM hyperparameters using grid search for enhanced model performance.
Delivered actionable insights for resource allocation and academic support strategies.
Predicting Smoking Behavior Using Socioeconomic and Mental Health Factors
R, Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression
Cleaned and preprocessed data from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to predict smoking behavior based on mental health status, education level, and income.
Conducted exploratory data analysis using ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of smoking behavior across education levels and mental health status.
Performed Chi-squared test and ANOVA to analyze the relationship between smoking behavior (SMOKE100) and education (EDUCA) and mental health (MENTHLTH), finding a significant association between smoking and both factors.
Built logistic regression models to predict smoking behavior with mental health and education level, and mental health and income level, yielding insights into key predictors of smoking behavior.
Tools: R (data manipulation, ggplot2, statistical modeling)
